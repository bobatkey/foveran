would it be OK to just assume that 'symmetry' exists?

need to make rewriteBy handle the following:
 - do not unfold every definition when looking for what to rewrite
 - get it the right way round
 - easy rewriting back and forth
 - handle equalities between pairs by splitting them into two rewrites...
 - possibly some unification?
