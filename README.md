# Foveran

A dependently typed programming language.

To compile this you will need Forvie to generate the lexer. This is
available from [https://github.com/bobatkey/Forvie](https://github.com/bobatkey/Forvie).



## Known Bugs

* The universe cummulativity checker is broken (doesn't extend the
    subtyping to Pis and Sigmas)
